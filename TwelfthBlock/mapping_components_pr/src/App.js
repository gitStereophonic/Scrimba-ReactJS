 * Given a list of products (as an array of objects, as seen in productsData.js)
 * render a <Product /> component (which you'll also need to create) for each
 * product in the list.
 *
 * Make sure to use the array's `.map()` method to create these components, and 
 * don't forget to pass a `key` prop to it to avoid the warning.
